# IMDB Movie Data

### Business Problem
I have been hired to process and analyze IMDB's extensive publicly-available dataset, supplement it with financial data from TMDB's API, convert the raw data into a MySQL database, and then use that database for extracting insights and recommendations on how to make a successful movie.

I will use a combination of machine-learning-model-based insights and hypothesis testing to extract insights for our stakeholders.
 
### Specifications/Constraints
- The stakeholder wants to focus on attributes of the movies themselves vs. the actors and directors connected to those movies.
- They only want to include information related to movies released in the United States.
- They also did not want to include movies released before the year 2000.
- The stakeholder is particularly interested in how the MPAA rating, genre(s), runtime, budget, and production companies influence movie revenue and user ratings.
